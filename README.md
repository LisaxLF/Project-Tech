# Project-Tech
Project Tech is a project i'm working on for Hogeschool van Amsterdam | CMD. This is my repository in which i will continue to share and update files about the matching-application assignment.

## Matching Application

My matching application is a matchmaking platform for all kinds of gamers. It gets pretty boring if you dont have any friends to play with or all of them suck. With this matchmaking application you can explore and find new friends, who are also a lot better at the game. Its all based on your own preferences, you want to play with a better teammate? Choose a higher rank preference! The idea of this app is whenever you got a match, you have to play a game. After the game you have to go back to the app to leave a rating for the other player. does this player suck? Just leave an already written message, after the rating you can cancel the match and keep looking for other gamers.
